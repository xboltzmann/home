    <center>**"Responsibility & Accountability"**<center>

    Emphasize and value in humans -> Responsibility & Accountability: blame no one, take ownership

    The non-accountable & irresponsible: placing blame on their life on other people, gaslighting & creating/forming narratives for justifications, corruption and opposite of the truth
    
    Be honest, be truthful, be humble, egoless<

    Admit your mistakes, learn & improve

    Recognize, appreciate and acknowledge, no matter how small (the progress) - is an improvement nonetheless


## question thyself
1. If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?
