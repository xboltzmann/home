    ``` title="Responsibility & Accountability"
    Emphasize and value -> Responsibility & Accountability: blame no one, take ownership
        The non-accountable & irresponsible: placing blame on their life on other people, gaslighting & creating/forming narratives for justifications, corruption and opposite of the truth
    

    Be honest, be truthful, be humble, egoless 

    Admit your mistakes, learn & improve

    Recognize, appreciate and acknowledge, no matter how small (the progress) - is an improvement nonetheless
