## introduction
!!! note ""
    I am a generalist, and forever a student (truth-seeker, curious/questioning), constantly evolving (growing, learning/understanding, unlearning/relearning) with mindful-awareness, humility, empathy and integrity forward (and towards) progression - to provide insights & value through my experiences (mistakes made & yet to be made); in-the-hopes of/ideally leaving a net positive impact (physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, whatever it may be). I can't guide you, but maybe-just maybe, I can give you the stepping-stones (sense of direction), the piece(s) of the puzzle that may help-supplement/complement, or the little speck of light in the darkness to push you forward to finding your true (meaningful, fulfilling) calling of the soul (psyche)
