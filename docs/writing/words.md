*You do not know what treasures are within you.*

*Sleep is an investment in tomorrow.*

*You are not what happened to you. Do not be bounded by your stories and experiences, that says that's who I am, that's what I am defined by or spending my life trying to differentiate myself from that, get away from that*

*Though I know the good, I do not do the good*

*A child can't fix a parent.* -James Hollis

*Tell me not your politics or your religion. Tell me only your suffering.*

*What happens if I have the biggest pile of sand at the end of my life? Well, you can't take it with you. But in the end, it's only sand, money is only money. What was your life about - that is the question. Women have to ask that, men have to ask that.*

*Something in each of us always knows what is right for us. If we pay attention and if we are willing to honor what emerges & have enough courage to address that - then we can live in a different way*

*If you don't address what's going on inside you, you are going to be simply a creature of adaptation and you are going to lose your way sooner or later*

*It is mortality that makes this life meaningful. Life means something because your choices is finite - you don't live here forever.*

*Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with. Hardship will show you who your real friends are.*

sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick - don't lose faith. you have got to find what you love and that is true for work as it is for your lovers. your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied, is to do what *you* believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. so keep looking, **don't settle**.

if today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? and whenever the answer have been no for too many days in a row, i know i need to change something. remembering that i'll be dead soon, is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid thinking you have something to lose. you are already naked, there is no reason not to follow your heart. no one wants to die. even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. and yet, death is the destination we all share. no one has ever escaped it. and that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. it's life's change agent. it clears out hte old to make way for the new. right now, the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner-voice. and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. they somehow already know what you truly want to become, everything else is secondary.

*I am not going to attack your character - your actions do that for you.*
-nobody

*The worst prison in the world is a home without peace (comfort, love, the feeling of warmth, protection & safety) - a place where you avoid until the late evenings but only to return to where your bed is (no other option as you are born into a family)* 
-nobody

*Find people/community whom truly have your best interest in mind. You will complement each other, support each other - to improve and grow* 
-nobody

*find something you truly love (to do-interests-curiosity-satisfaction, partner(s), friends, community/tribe, thyself), and you'll have the foundations/back-bone to endure anything (event, changes, life). you'll have the courage, the confidence (mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually) and the support to start over again. if you haven't found it yet, follow your heart and intuition, keep looking and don't settle*
