*"You do not know what treasures are within you."*

*Sleep is an investment in tomorrow.*

*I am not going to attack your character - your actions do that for you.*
-Nobody

*You are not what happened to you. Do not be bounded by your stories and experiences, that says that's who I am, that's what I am defined by or spending my life trying to differentiate myself from that, get away from that*

Though I know the good, I do not do the good
