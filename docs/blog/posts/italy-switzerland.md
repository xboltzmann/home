# Milan, Italy : June 5 - June 7

## June 5 : Day 1 - Arrival
I've flown to Milan, Italy from the east coast - the total in-air-flight time is approximately 10-hours. I had a layover in Barcelona, Spain for 3.5 hours. Flight got an hour-ish delayed departing from the east coast so layover time reduced. So here is how it looks:

  east coast -> Barcelona, Spain = 8-hours
  Barcelona, Spain (layover) = 3.5-hours
  Barcelona, Spain -> Milan Italy = 1-hour & 40-minutes

Arrived in Milan, Italy in the late afternoon and went to pickup the car rental which was fairly easy and straight forward. We called the car rental and they send a shuttle to pick us up. The car rental was approximately 12-15 minutes away from airport and once I got there signed some papers, provided my paperwork (license, passport, international drivers permit) and off we went to our airbnb which was about a 40-minute drive. 

We arrived at our accommodations in the late evening (9pm) and settled in and looked for a place to dine. We ended up at this cute little spot at the end of a residential area which we walked to (15-mins). The food is hella good and affordable in Milan - apps were 9-10 euros, entrees were 10-12 euros, dessert (4-5 euros) and this is all inclusive of seafood && pasta. First meal we got was:

  apps = mussels & clams (10euros), calamari (9euros) & spinach (8euros)
  entrees = pasta with clams (11euros) & steak (12euros)
  dessert = tiramisu (4euros)

After completing the meal, the waitress said it is a tradition that after your first meal (I think) you are to take a shot of liquor. She was hella sweet and kind and said it was on the house.

## June 6 : Day 2 - City-Exploration
Today was the day of city exploration. One of my favorite things to do aka do what the locals do, immersify and acclimate myself via taking the public transit (Red M line), walk around the city, check out parks, churches, people watch, understand the structure of the city with absolutely no fixed/strict plans nor time constraints and to just wander, get a little lost and enjoy/appreciate. This is my way of getting comfortable in a new city - a new place that I've never been to

We departed early noon/afternoon (12:00-13:00) to find the train station transit (12ish minutes walk from accommodations). Struggled and was a bit confused at first and couldn't really understand it (dumb small-brained americanos) but after awhile we sorta made some sense of it and just followed the colors and decided where our destination. We decided to purchase a day ticket (8euros) which can take transit all day within the M2-Zone. Unlike the grid system in NYC, Milan has a circular-area-zone system (sorry a little confusing but bare with me), whereas the center/heart of Milan is M1, and the further you go out it goes to M2, M3, M4, etc.

We got out to the city and wandered around and somehow ended up at Parco Sempione, which was beautiful and grand. The entrance was like entering a castle into a huge park and unbeknownst to me, this was free. We explored the park and there was so much space and ample benches & seating, as such, we sat down on a bench and chilled there for a bit to people watch. Highly recommend visiting here if you are strolling around Milan.

After, we headed south-westish and visited Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio & Santa Maria delle Grazie (also free) - so dope. The structure, architecture and the way they are able to maintain it so well is unreal. And by the way, when entering Basilica (churches), don't forget to take off your cap.

Then, we headed and walked through the shopping district area towards Duomo di Milano, but we never got there and decided to head back home and figure out dinner.

For dinner, we found a spot (25-30 minutes walk) and after all day of walking, we was famished and got pretty much a buffet (2x pizzas, muscles & clams, 2x pasta). It's hella funny when the waiters/waitress and people around look at us and get a giggle in seeing us ordering food for literally a family - which also probably gave them a good idea that we were dumb small-brained fat americanos. We finished grubbing and had leftovers for take-away aka Italians' way of saying to-go/take-out.

A very productive day of exploring and lots of walking (30K steps).
