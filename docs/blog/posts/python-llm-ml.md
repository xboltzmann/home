# What a time to be alive

Open-source, coding, programming, machine-learning, large-language-models - what a time to be alive.

So many opportunities, so much tech, so many options.

To be able to create a Local RAG Agent via Python + Streamlit + Embedchain + Groq (Llama3) and insert specific data is wild. From PDFs to docs, to website & documentation. I'm fully amazed and stunned at what I'm learning, and I've barely scratched the service.

Excited to continue learning & improving through iterations with a growth mindset - to create and build something that provides value (whether improving efficiency, increasing output, reducing friction, etc.). To do so, I must hone the foundational skills, technicalities and understanding necessary from 0 to 0.01.

Lucky to be here with all my limps in tack & having the basics necessities (internet, laptop, a home).

Everything else is on me - my drive, my hunger, and my desire.
