# Quarter 1 of 2024

This year is flying by hella quick. Especially when you are doing something that you enjoy. I can recall my younger days being in school, in class and time was going by so slow. I'd stare at the clock as it slowly ticks second-by-second, watching the minute ticker move ever so slowly 6-degrees at a time. 

I always wondered why and now that I've matured (sort of) and is more aware, it is because I absolutely did not want to be there, had no interest in the subject, and/or did not enjoy being there (required and expected of). I just had no interest in being forced into what was considered normal/standardized way of learning, IE: going to school and attending a fixed curriculum of classes. I never understood how someone can finish high-school and have a grasp of what they wanted to major in and decide on a career in life. I had no idea what I wanted to do, and I was very confident that I would have absolutely no idea what I wanted to do once I graduated - and being forced with a decision to apply to colleges with a good sense of what you want to do was beyond me. It never made sense to me.

1. I had no idea what I was really interested in (yet) nor wanted to do - so I was aimlessly learning. Nothing captivated me and if I had any sense of what pulled me in, I could have focused on the pre-requisites and foundations to pursue that interest - which would lead to careers that I wanted to be in.

Thus, at a very young age, I dropped out and ended up playing video games since it captivated me. But I really wish I had the right people around me to breakdown & simplify the complexities of video-games and how to create it via technologies of coding. Now, I have a better understanding, that games are literally created out of nothing - these vast, beautiful worlds that tells stories.
