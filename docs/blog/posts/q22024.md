# Quarter 2 of 2024: Intro
Half-way through the year - lots of internal work, introspection, unlearning/relearning, facing/unraveling the demons, understanding & acceptance. Traveled & explored, visited the place I was born/raised, seeing friends & family


## The Demon(s): Self-love, Understanding & Acceptance
The self-realization of the demons surfaced something within me that has been repressed & suppressed my whole life. It forced me to step back, review and examine all the experiences & the patterns it followed - how it played out, why it played out like this or that, how I've come to these decisions, how did I get here. It boils down that I was not provided the equivalent or even close to the support, love and encouragement. Instead was consistently & constantly doubted, disapproval, given negative criticism & judgement, manipulation/gaslighting, disregarding my feelings/thoughts & inputs, never championing/focusing on my successes/accomplishments & the struggles, what i'm suppose to do, this is how it's done and the only way, etc. - this is my shadow

Understanding this has created and led me to a path of healing, self-love & acceptance. Being more gentle, patient & kinder to myself and giving myself the space & time for introspection & the inner-work

What comes after acceptance are branches of infinite paths; fearless & confident, constrained by nothing with endless unimaginable possibilities


## Travels
On a more positive-note, I did some traveling: Boston -> Italy -> Switzerland -> Boston. Italy & Switzerland each uniquely has its charms and without a doubt both are gorgeous places filled with beautiful humans. I wrote more about it in details in a separate post, go read it there


## Ending Thoughts
With focus & priority on the self holistically: ***anyone can get it***
