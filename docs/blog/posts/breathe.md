# The Lost Art of Breathing

Book Source: [Breath by James Nestor](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Breath/6lS9DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)

## Notes

- Complex & not binary

- Unconsciously = survival

- Consciously = durability, strength, extension, mindful, longevity, rejuvenate
  
- The ability to breathe correctly can heal and prevent a lot of life ailments (asthma, snoring, autoimmune disease, scoliosis)

## Actionable

- Breathe through the nose -> inhale 5.5 seconds, exhale 5.5 seconds
