    Value in humans: Responsibility & Accountability: blame no one, take ownership, admit your mistakes, be honest, egoless, truthful / truth-seeking, compassionate and learn & improve

    The non-accountable & irresponsible: placing blame on their life on other people, gaslighting & creating/forming narratives for justifications, corruption, selfishness to the benefit of themselves and opposite of the truth
    
    Recognize, appreciate and acknowledge, no matter how small (the progress) - is an improvement nonetheless

1. Don't know what to write? -> Just start writing: No one is watching, no one is reading - write for yourself & experiment

2. If you have readers, followers, an audience - great. It means they are interested in what you have to say/write

3. Write about *all* your interests. Make a lot of noise and let your audience decide what they want to hear more of from you. A few poorly written posts are not the end of the world; it's data - to collect, understand, learn and improve

4. Be transparent, honest, authentic and genuine - to create and foster a community of people whom share the same values, ethics, passion & interests

1. The great gifts of relationships, if you can tolerate it, is the otherness of the other - produces the dialect, produces the enlargement that comes from encountering the other. I've learn some much from my wife and I believe she's learned a few things from me -- our ongoing dialogue cause we are similar and very different. At times been conflictual, naturally. But most the pattern of growth (development, understanding of one-self) because we are allowed to bring in that other perspective and see the same reality - my wife has taught me to see some things that I wouldn't have seen before because she has an artist-eye. On the other hand there are places where you have to come up (self-individually) against what is central and critical to your own well-being or your own integrity and then you have to stand for that. The wisdom to know which-is-which at any given time is not inbred. It's one of those times where we have to find the balancing-point, between legitimate dialogue and compromise and sacrifice in a relationship. There's a place for sacrifice, but at the same time there's a place where you have to say 'all right, but I have to separate myself here and stand for this on the other-side of that'. It takes a solomonic-wisdom to know always what's right, but over time one can get a sense of what's that about. That's why we have to individuate as individuals (by definition), but also in relationship. Because it's the otherness of the others that pulls us out of that self-referential system. Otherwise, we get caught in a circular dialogue among our complexes (for example). It's important to go up to the mountaintop to meditate, but if you stay up there too long, you'll be talking to ghosts - your complexes will be caught in this looping-cycle. And you need the other to pull you out of that into the presence of the other and it's out of that the third comes. (Triangle)

2. If you are constantly sacrificing to the other, you'll grow resentful. But if you are sacrificing to the project, the two of you launched together as a friendship or a marriage or whatever form it takes (partnership, relationship, etc.) - you can do that in a very constructive way. You're fed by that because you're mutually committed to the project that this relationship represents.

3. Tell me not your politics or your religion. Tell me only your suffering.

4. I'm not what happened to me. I am what is wanting to express in my life through me.

5. There is no formula that is applicable to everybody and their life's circumstances. The word psychotherapy literally means from the Greek, to listen to or pay attention to the soul. However you go about doing that is right for you - it's up to you to figure that out. And for some people be working in nature, for others to be working with their hands, for others it'll be through some creative Enterprise or working with their dreams or meditating, etc. - Whatever helps you step out of stimulus response-stimulus response melee that we call oru daily life is likely to be helpful to you either because you rest and restore the psyche and or you have some reflection upon. You REcollect yourself as it is, you REmember the self - because we get unraveled. I often have the feeling of getting unraveled in life, where this calls you and this calls you and that calls you and it's just pulling you away from some Center (something from within of self) here. This is not about self-absorption. But if I'm not in connection with something abiding here (The Center), my behaviors or choices there are not going to be very helpful in the long run - they're going to be merely responsive to the demands of the environmental circumstances.

6. Something in each of us always knows what is right for us. If we pay attention and if we are willing to honor what emerges & have enough courage to address that - then we can live in a different way.

7. The revolution in the history of women - their courage in addressing these stereotypes of what a women is and what she's suppose to do with her life, required men to start looking at themselves as well. Women has done us a great favor, not always recognized by men. In both cases, you have to say - the message you have from family of origin and culture may or may not work for you, but you are here in a certain way to deconstruct those expectations and find your own path. Irene Claremont de Castillejo, talked about the difference between focused-awareness and diffused-awareness. Rather than talk about gender, which is a social construct coming out of this culture, this culture or this culture - talk about those are two different modes of orientation to the world, and we need both. We need focused-awareness that's goal-directed behavior that is historically with the masculine and we also need this awareness of context and of relationships. This focused-awareness without relatedness leads to sterility and isolation, on the other hand, too diffused without a sense of directed and purposeful behavior means that one is fumbling one's way through life too. To be a man, is in a sense your requirement is to know what you want and to do it, but women have to do that too. The animus, the inner masculine or inner focused awareness, and that goal-directed behavior is what moves your life forward in a purposeful way. But for man, it's about becoming aware of context and relatedness. 

- Find a partner that will buy into the notion of genuine reciprocity - in our responsibility to each other & our work together
   
- Life is suffering - the question is: 
   (i). what does that suffering make you do?
   (ii). what does it keep you from doing?

- Shut-up, Suit-up, Show-up.

- Sooner or later, life knocks us down. Death is the great democracy. But you are here to live it as best you can -- by lights that matter within, instead of what people around you are saying. This is your life, you're accountable - what are you going to do about that?

- Despair is when one sees friends die, avenues in your life closed that you can't possibly do, you're confronted with the unlived life or the mistakes you've made, you're dealing with the lost of functions of the body, you are facing your mortality
   
- You are born into suffering, born into mortality, born into loss and so forth. If you are going to live, you are going to go through some of those - if you live long enough you'll go through the loss of people you love and care about. You may outlive your children. And sooner or later, life will take you to these difficult places. And what are you going to do, who are you then & how are you going to address that. To be a person of integrity, is to integrate something-to pull back one's stuff and sense this is who I am & this is where I stand via this dilemma. Practical question: how now will I live my life in the face of this situation? That's a task that comes to each of us at some place (event or time) in our life and that never goes away.
   
- You want the right answers, the key is to find the right questions and live the questions. You're not yet ready to live the answers. But if you ask the right questions - in time, if you live them honestly, with as much integrity as you can manage - someday, you'll live your way into the answers.
   
- Ask large questions, you'll live a large and interesting journey. Ask small questions and it gets diminished somehow.

- When you reach a decisive point in your life - we have to make a decision, one way or the other. Ask: 
  (i). Does this path enlarge me (psycho-spiritually) or does it diminish me?

- If you choose the larger path, you are going to grow and develop - it's going to take something out of you, but it'll give something to you. If you don't, you life gets narrower and narrower and narrower - and something inside of you knows the difference. Sooner or later, the psyche is going to show up with its point of view. And the more we fled from that kind of question, that kind of conversation - the more pathology is going to erupt when we've avoided the big question
