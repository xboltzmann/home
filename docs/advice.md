    <center>**"Advice, Values & Wisdom"**<center>

    Value in humans: Responsibility & Accountability: blame no one, take ownership, admit your mistakes, be honest, egoless, truthful / truth-seeking, compassionate and learn & improve

    The non-accountable & irresponsible: placing blame on their life on other people, gaslighting & creating/forming narratives for justifications, corruption, selfishness to the benefit of themselves and opposite of the truth
    
    Recognize, appreciate and acknowledge, no matter how small (the progress) - is an improvement nonetheless

1. Don't know what to write? -> Just start writing: No one is watching, no one is reading - write for yourself & experiment

2. If you have readers, followers, an audience - great. It means they are interested in what you have to say/write

3. Write about *all* your interests. Make a lot of noise and let your audience decide what they want to hear more of from you. A few poorly written posts are not the end of the world; it's data - to collect, understand, learn and improve

4. Be transparent, honest, authentic and genuine - to create and foster a community of people whom share the same values, ethics, passion & interests
