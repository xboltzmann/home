## Travels & Exploration

**I use to have neutral / sorta negative feelings towards traveling. This is solely due to my personal experiences - whether being forced to travel or other reasons I can't seem to verbalize / explain in words (right now).**

**And as I got older with the independence & freedom that comes with being an adult (job + income), I had more opportunities to travel. And from traveling, it create & strengthen bonds-friendships. It created unforgettable memories that filled my heart & soul and these memories, I cherish genuinely. Just the idea of being in a completely new place, where no one knows you & you have almost no chance of bumping into someone you know is fascinating (to me). To be able to explore new cities, cultures, the language(s), the history, its people & lifestyle - it's like you are an explorer and conquering new land in a game, where you are in a new town, a new city and everything is new - to me that is so fucking dope. In a way you are like being reborn again and just looking around digesting & trying understand everything since everything is completely new.**

**Through those experiences I've genuinely & wholeheartedly fallen in love with traveling.**
