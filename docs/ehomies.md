    humans I admire and learn from on the internet 
    whom have resonated & provided me indepth insight, knowledge and guidance
    through different lenses, experiences & perspectives 
    that keeps me curious, helps me better understand and 
    most importantly to keep moving forward and continuously put in the work and grow
